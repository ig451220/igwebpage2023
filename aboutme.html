          <h2>I'm Israel Garcia</h2>
          <p>I was born in Oceanside, California but when I was very young my parents took me to live in Mexico in a small town called Zumpahuacan. In that small town I met my parents' family, made friends, learned things and kept many memories. Until I turned 12, my parents wanted to return to California so that I could learn the language, the culture, and have the opportunity to graduate in a career that would bring me a bright future. So now I study at Santa Ana High School and I am a junior and I will graduate in 2024.</p>
